# Mitty 0th Annual Python Bee

Inspired by MIT's East Campus "Bad Ideas Weekend" Nth Annual Python Bee

The idea is simple: You receive a coding problem, and you dictate the solution
in python character-by-character to a judge.

## Rules
* Dictate solution character-by-character (including newlines/whitespace)
* Cannot delete anything that has been typed (only can clear current line)
* Cannot use paper or computer to solve the problem

## Problems
Problems are stored in their respective directories along with a test file
`tests.py` that checks all function-based problems
